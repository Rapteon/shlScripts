#Place this script inside a directory which is included in your PATH or add the directory to your PATH.

#Dependencies: Not any you need to install.

#Working: This script is used to remove error logs from /var/crash. These logs create the annoying notification on Ubuntu "System program problem detected."
#	However, I recommend reading the errors in this directory before running this script.
#! /usr/bin/env bash


sudo rm /var/crash/*
